# haskell-dfa-project

Part of a university assignment to manipulate Discrete Finite Automata. Skelelton provided as part of the assignment and functions defined by me. To run requires other haskell files not included as they were written by the lecturer but just put this up to show experience in working with Haskell and with more mathematical problems.
